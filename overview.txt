                Shedding light on the distressing reality of violence against Afghan women in the aftermath of the Taliban's resurgence. This timeline vividly illustrates critical events, starting with the Taliban's return to power in August 2021, leading to subsequent actions that significantly impact women's rights in Afghanistan.
            </p>

            <p>
                Delve into the discriminatory laws enforced by the Taliban, revealing a systematic erosion of women's rights. From May 7, 2022, when the Taliban Virtue and Vice Ministry mandated all-encompassing robes and face coverings for women in public, to November 10, 2022, with the nationwide ban on women using gyms and parks, witness the escalating curtailment of freedoms.
            </p>

            <p>
                Events like the public flogging on November 20, 2022, and the execution of a convicted killer on December 8, 2022, underscore an alarming intensification in punitive measures. The bans on female students attending university (December 21, 2022) and working with national and international NGOs (December 24, 2022) further restrict women's participation in public life.
            </p>

            <p>
                As the timeline unfolds, the situation worsens, culminating in the United Nations declaring Afghanistan the most repressive country for women and girls on March 9, 2023. The Taliban's persistent crackdown on beauty salons (July 4, 2023) and the use of stun guns on protesting women (July 19, 2023) highlight the escalating violence and suppression faced by Afghan women.
            </p>

            <p>
                Our interactive timeline visually juxtaposes the rising attacks against women with the enactment of discriminatory laws. Witness the correlation between legal restrictions and the increasing violence against Afghan women since the Taliban takeover.
            </p>

            <p>
                This timeline isn't just a chronological record; it provides a deeper understanding of the impact of Taliban policies on women's safety and rights. By weaving together data on attacks, involved actors, and fatalities with the legislative timeline, our project effectively illustrates the worsening situation for Afghan women. It emphasizes the urgent need for your attention and collective action to address this humanitarian crisis. Explore, engage, and join us in raising awareness about the challenges faced by Afghan women today.
